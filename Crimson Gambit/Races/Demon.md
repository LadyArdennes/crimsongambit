Regular creatures who came into contact with the 'demon virus', demons have earned this name from their unholy abilities and thousands of years of being outcasts. While they're not inherently evil beings, it is difficult to live as a good demon. Anyone with a nervous system (human or not) can become a demon, but returning to your previous state is considered impossible. Demons:

- Do not need to eat regular food, sleep or drink water. Humans who became demons still feel phantom hunger.,
- Find it much harder to feel emotions, their souls are tainted and the horror within must be actively pushed back at all times,
- Have an immense craving to feast on non-demons. Untainted Humans are the most appetizing meal to a demon, but animals and similar creatures will hold off the urge in a pinch. While a demon does not need to eat to live, they will grow more unstable the longer they go without feasting,
- Live for a seemingly unlimited amount of time, though they are rare and usually battle eachother.,
- Their lack of a real human body makes them a bad pick for shadow monsters. Shadow monsters will never reach their true potential while their host is a demon.,

A notable demon in the world of Crimson Gambit is Scuro Mezogna, a powered person who was brought back to life as a demon and terrorized many across the world.
