The main attraction of Crimson Gambit, powered people are creatures who possess the 'alpha genome'. This can occur naturally from birth or in rare cases be given to someone through magical/scientific means. The first set of powered people are said to have appeared during the second world war, with much stronger powers than nowadays. A person can only have one power, and two people may only have the same power if they are related by blood. Due to the sheer versatility in powered people, they only share a few things in common: Powered People:

- Do not have to be human. Humans, Demons and even some animals can have a power.,
- Can be detected by technology like the DCU's power scanners,

A notable powered person in the world of Crimson Gambit is...a lot of people, an example being Jay Salem, with the power to share his body parts with other people
