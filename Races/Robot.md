The year is 2035, and the already advanced technology of the world has reached the point where sentient but **expensive** robots are possible. Of course robots come in all shapes and sizes and don't have to be sentient, but there are some ground rules when it comes to making and playing one Robots:

- Are different from cyborgs of course.,
- Unless they are drones and smaller machines that act as a tool for other characters, robots must be submitted as separate characters from their makers. These robots are subject to all the character creation rules of CG and must be of a similar or lower power level than all other races.,
- Can come in all sorts of forms and AI can be moved to and from different bodies. This comes with a few ethics problems, but they can be copied, deleted and modified by those with the right knowledge.,
- Like demons, robots are rare and their existence needs to be justified.,
- Can't be powered, as they do not possess any DNA to begin with.,

Robots are currently a rare thing in CG lore, but the DCU experimented with the idea back before they were overthrown.
