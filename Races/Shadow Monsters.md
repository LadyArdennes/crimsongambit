Creatures born from dark magic that are one with the shadows around them. They are usually fully sentient, though their reliance on a human host often slows their mental development. Shadow monsters are a biproduct of a horrible evil that once terrorized the world, but that doesn't make any individuals inherently evil. Shadow Monsters:

- Often cling onto hosts to greatly enhance their survivability and power. Once a shadow monster bonds with someone, they are stuck with them until removed by magical means,
- Can sink into and hide in the darkness around their host, being able to slip into one shadow and appear from another,
- Are far better off with a regular human than a powered person or demon, as the human's lack of magic gives them room to develop,

A notable shadow monster in Crimson Gambit is Seth, who bonded to Elizabeth Mezogna and fought against the master of shadows.
